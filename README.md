# SQL Practices using MySQL Workbench
## Practice 1
Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpmiller/employee-attrition-for-healthcare

NB: The file was split into two: "Demographics" and "Workinfo" so that I could practise JOIN function
1) Exploration of dataset
2) Practice of aggregate function
3) Practice of "Join" function (INNER JOIN)
4) Create Common Table Expressions
5) Create Temp Table
6) Create View

## Practice 2
Dataset from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx

NB: It seemed that MySQL Workbench automatically remove rows that contain NULL values. Any idea to turn off this function will be appreciated. Thank you!:)

1) Finding and handling of NULL values
2) Practice of SUBSTRING_INDEX (aka PARSENAME in other SQL applications)
3) Practice of ALTER TABLE (add column, drop column), UPDATE table
4) Pratice of "CASE WHEN THEN ELSE END"
5) Practice of ROW_NUMBER () over (PARTITION BY)
